# Tricholoracetic Acid (TCA) Precipitation


## Notes

TCA should be stored with acids, and prepared/dispensed in the chemical safety hood.

## Preparation

1. Resuspend the solid TCA at 100%(w/v). 
    > For 100 g bottle, resuspend in 100 ml H<sub>2</sub>O. Note the date of resuspenion on the bottle.

2. Microcentrifuge at 4 °C.

3. Chill acetone at 4 °C.

## Precipitation

1. Prepare an ice bucket. For each sample, prepare a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and place in the ice bucket.

1. Aliquot 50 μl TCA into each tube. Allow to chill.

1. Measure the OD<sub>600</sub> of the culture.

1. Add 1 ml cell culture to TCA.
    >  Final concentration of 5%(w/v) TCA 

1. Remain on ice for at least 30 min.
    > Can move the ice bucket to the cold room for longer periods, or if taking time-course samples.

1. Pellet for 20 min at max speed (> 20,000 x g) at 4 °C.

1. Pipet off the supernatant (TCA).

1. Add 500 μl acetone to neutralize the pellet.
    > If the pellet is tight then you can immediately remove the acetone. Otherwise pellet again.

1. Resuspend in SDS sample buffer equal to OD<sub>600</sub>/6 (in milliliters) for each sample.

1. Store at -20 °C.
