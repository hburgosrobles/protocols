# Sequence Tagged Gene Deletion
by Hector Burgos

This protocol details how to generate a clean deletion of target genes in *Vibrio fischeri* where each deletion strain is tagged with a unique sequence or "barcode".
SOE-PCR is used to generate the Mutagenic DNA (linear dsDNA carrying Erm<sup>R</sup> and the barcode, flanked by FRT sites and upstream and downstream homology to target gene; arranged as follows: US homology-FRT-Erm<sup>R</sup>-FRT-barcode-DS homology) and *tfoX* transformation is used to insert it into *V. fischeri* where it recombines into the chromosome based on sequence homology.
This technique then allows for the excision of the Erm<sup>R</sup> cassette by expressing FLP recombinase, which uses the FRT sites to remove the antibiotic cassette.
The resulting scar is in-frame (reduces likelihood of polar effects on gene expression) and carries a barcode that allows identification of the specific deletion strain through sequencing.
One important detail is that the start codon and the last 7 aa (including stop codon) of the targeted gene are preserved and form part of the deletion scar.
The overall approach is summarized below:

Oligos F1 and R1-LUH amplify 1Kb upstream of target gene including the start codon, while oligos F2-RUH and R2 amplify the 1 Kb downstream of target gene including the last 7 and stop codons.
Oligo FO anneals 1.5 Kb upstream of target gene and is used to amplify from outside the junction of the mutation to verify insertion of cassette in correct genomic location.
Oligos FW and RW anneal within target gene and should produce no product from a successful gene deletion strain.
