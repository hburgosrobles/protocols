# Sequence Tagged Gene Deletion
by Hector Burgos

This protocol details how to generate a clean deletion of target genes in *Vibrio fischeri* where each deletion strain is tagged with a unique sequence or "barcode".
SOE-PCR is used to generate the Mutagenic DNA (linear dsDNA carrying Erm<sup>R</sup> and the barcode, flanked by FRT sites and upstream and downstream homology to target gene; arranged as follows: US homology-FRT-Erm<sup>R</sup>-FRT-barcode-DS homology) and *tfoX* transformation is used to insert it into *V. fischeri* where it recombines into the chromosome based on sequence homology.
This technique then allows for the excision of the Erm<sup>R</sup> cassette by expressing FLP recombinase, which uses the FRT sites to remove the antibiotic cassette.
The resulting scar is in-frame (reduces likelihood of polar effects on gene expression) and carries a barcode that allows identification of the specific deletion strain through sequencing.
One important detail is that the start codon and the last 7 aa (including stop codon) of the targeted gene are preserved and form part of the deletion scar.
The overall approach is summarized below:
