# Shelf Stocking Protocol

* Make sure items labeled with older dates are in the front so they can be used first
* Plates without antibiotics in the cold room can last for about a year; plates with antibiotics can last about 3 months
* If liquid media is cloudy, it is contaminated and needs to be disposed of
* Regularly check media and throw out anything that looks contaminated or is too old
