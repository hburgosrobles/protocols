# Cyclic-di-GMP extraction

Extraction buffer (store at -20°C, replace after 2 weeks).

Reagent      | Amount        | E.g. 10mL solution
------------ | --------------|--------------
Acetonitrile | 40% (v/v)     | 4mL
Methanol     | 40% (v/v)     | 4mL
Formic acid  | 0.1 N         | 400uL
dI H<sub>2</sub>O | adjust to desired volume | 1.6mL 

1. Grow strains overnight at 25°C, shaking in LBS.

1. Dilute overnight cultures 1:80 in LBS and grow shaking at 25°C until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.5-1.8 (late log) or 2.2-2.8 (stationary phase).

1. Transfer 1.5 ml into a 1.7 ml microfuge tube, and centrifuge at 22,000 x g for 1 min.

1. Remove the supernatant by aspiration, resuspend the remaining pellet in 200 μl of cold extraction buffer.

1. Incubate samples at -20°C for 30 minutes.

1. Centrifuge at 22,000 x g for 5 minutes to pellet the cellular debris (centrifuge and extract supernatant in batches of ≤ 10).

1. Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.7 ml microfuge tube, and store at -80°C.
